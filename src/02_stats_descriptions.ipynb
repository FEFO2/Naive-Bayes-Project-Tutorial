      "ok for the simple stuff feature lacking and poor layout for your basic messaging its fine but it still lacks sending voice messages and video clips can be a bit slow to load conversations overall the recent changes in ui make it feel cloogy simple actions like opening the app or going back to the message listview shows a signing in spinner  which is obviously not ideal for every other action especially since it uses google auth services \n",

      "why cant google get it for a company being the most used internet search engine you would think google would be smart enough to conjure a team up to fix these problems they have i also agree with a few others who thinks google messages and hangouts should combine somehow to make it work how the iphones imessage works\n",

      "rubbish the amount of memory it gives for free is rubbish its very little compared to one drive they also need to fix the drop box when you upload or dowload large files it doesnt do it straight away generally expensive to get more memory need to give more free memory without crazy price tiers never will i use drop box again people out there check other clouds eg one drive gmail drive just other drives very dissapointed with dropbox\n",

      "bait and switch i purchased my 3rd samsung tablet with  advertisement of free gifts one of them being 48 additional gb cloud storage for 2 years  the 2nd samsung tablet i bought also had this free gift and it was a nightmare to get samsung and dropbox to honor it  so after buying this 3rd high end tablet with the same claim of the free 48gb for 2 years in the fine print which you can only see after purchasing the tablet dropbox only honors the offer on the first device you purchased and you are disqualified for all future devices  this is sleazy and bait and switch  free not subject to any compensation encumbrance repayment in kind etc  because of this bait and switch advertising on the part of samsung and dropbox i suggest you really find out what kind of company dropbox is before using their services\n",
      "looks great works well and supports ubuntu but needs removable storage support an application like this is only as good as the service behind it and this is where dropbox excels  it works flawlessly securely and even has a native client available for linuxbased operating systems ubuntu and steamos my only real complaint is the lack of support for removable storage such as micro sdxc memory cards for which a star is lost\n",
      "cool app except the notifications freeze so i have no idea of the upload status even worse dunno if it even worked or safe to delete those files becomes more of a broken app to me another issue i wanted to create a new account for a friends new phone exclaimed that 2 year 50 gig is available and it shows it is until after you waste time following all of your steps to get 250 mbs or something worthless keep it honest\n",

      "widget sabotaged this app functions ok as a notetaker i access it primarily through its widget the old widget was great giving a peek at a few recent notes then that widget was killed off and replaced with a widget that shows only the titles of 2 recent notes with maybe just part of the title of a third note and no content at all it shows poor judgment for a company to downgrade its product for no apparent reason also theres no undo button\n",
      "ever so useful evernote it is so easy to scribble something down when you have your smart phone tablet laptop or whatever  you can be spontaneous yet accurate because you write when you are at the place and at the time  when you return to your main computer your writing is there waiting for you  almost magical  such a time saver and a memory keeper\n",

      "very solid my one real complaint is no way to make anchor tags within a note so i can make a table of contents otherwise great application\n",
      "too much going on its cool it works but ony using it because i have to its got way to much going on for a note pad adds in useless irrelevant information like i made a note on a friends birthday now it says from so and sos birthday but it works great just wish it was just a plain jane note pad like the one htc used this app to replace if there was a way to over complicate a note pad app they did itit works great like i said and it takes some getting used to and it grows on you\n",
      "makes life better evernote has saved my bacon multiple times because i could easily find a picture of my drivers license or info on airline clubs or a receipt i needed  i used to keep info like that in contacts and it is much more difficult to search for that way and it clogs up your contacts  plus you can save screenshots websites pictures  anything  and they are searchable\n",

      "neat idea but letdown by no linux support an application like evernote is only as useful as the service behind it and the service behind a concept like evernote is only as useful as the availability of an application or program to connect to said service which is where evernote fails  it is not natively available for linuxbased operating systems such as ubuntu sure the android application works well enough  but when the only way to access evernote under a linuxbased operating system is via a web browser it quickly looses its appeal\n",
      "great application but the premium notifications have become too invasive leading to unpleasant clutter alternative options are becoming much more attractive due to this\n",
      "fantastic and helpful i find this app so helpful i have the paid version wouldnt really want the free version as i love being able to take photos of business cards and turn them into contacts it also has the ability to find text within pdfs which is also extremely useful\n",

      "absolutely the best for saving documents forms notes or whatever it is that you may end up needing on the go  you can have one or twenty different books to store and organize your information in  edit word and excel documents without having to save them to your computer and save them again into your books  tag one document in ten different locations so if you can use it in multiple different situations you dont have to worry about where you saved it  just look it up under the tag that you need to use it for  its that easy\n",
      "confusing i used the app to import important notes from another smartphone note book to my current phone although it transferred the information it is so hard to find it it disappeared completely\n",
      "camera option is horrible you cant crop the image sideways it has to be perfect square or rectangle  camscanner or microsoft lens are  better options for document images and it needs notebooks within notebooks the camera flash always on and when you do needs it it takes very long time to turn itself off after taking the picture the document camera likewise needs to detect the edge of the document editing the images must be done within the interface without going through skitch\n",
      "the most useful app in the marketplace if used properly    if youve ever thought how nice it would be to get rid of all the paper and clutter in your life and yet still have it available anytimeall the time using powerful searches then evernote is for you take a picture of anything and store it scan paper using your smart phone or scanner and store it all in a note forward emails directly into evernote drag and drop computer files create a note using your finger in handwriting or text mode clip pages or parts of web pages use voice   \n",

      "its useful a great app and pretty much an essential part of my organization a minor complaint is that the desktop program doesnt look as appealing as the mobile app and that the mobile version is lacking some useful functions eg the ability to delete tags or to strikethrough text\n",
      "great app  good tool for my arsenal its like a virtual notebook or binder or file cabinet for me and its wonderful  i use different apps for quick notes and tasks i would use it for tasks if it had repeating reminders  ability to snooze them then also sync wgoogle calendar but if i need to save longterm notes or receipts or travel plans prayers  spiritual writings howtos etc evernote is the app for that  easy to use never loses my notes it is dependable and reliable  i love using the desktop version also\n",

      "new user great app have suggestions so far i love working with the app on all devices desktop web  android phone it integrates very well with other related apps however i would give 5 stars if developers could do 2 things 1 allow check boxesbullet items to be easily reordered dragdrop its kind of a big deal for me and 2 allow duplication of notes if these functions already exist then hopefully someone will share how to do it or ill figure it out soon enough and then ill gladly rate 5 stars great job guys\n",

      "useful app very useful app in my opinion note taking is great with voice recognition being able to add pics brings a nice presentation aspect when sharing with a group the functionality just needs to keep improving for the average person to be perfect\n",
      "really cool and organized the new update is really amazing the widgets are cool however it would be helpful if you could add right to left reading and writing support like hebrew cause when i want to add check box the text removed to the left also you need to add an option to change the size of the preview dont like its so small and app animations would be nice something else to your attention i want to by the app but it really really expensive if it was cheaper and one time charge i would buy it\n",
      "nice app i suggest you to add a wordcount feature and font size i think its essential feature for a note app but well keep the good things up youve done a really amazing job thanks  \n",

      "all you need easy and gives you control openness and ease of use are clearly the main goals the software itself is great and the various plugins available allow for even more control and customization if you want it great job\n",
      "surprised been atleast 3 years since i switched to chrome on pc it was by chance and some luck that i stumbled upon firefox for android im absolutely hooked proper tabbed browsing helps me keep my jungle of open app state screenshots a lot simpler my favorite feature would be queing new links from other apps to be opened later neato made me install firefox again on all my other devices after a long time good going mozilla \n",
      "keeps crashing i really do love the browser overall and the ability to install addons and plugins is amazing but it keeps crashing on me all the time ill be browsing a page and then all of a sudden the page wont scroll for me ill try and zoom in and the font wont rerender and i cant click on anything however the ui still functions normally but i cant get anything to work on the webpages if that could somehow be fixed itd ramp ya back up to 5 stars\n",
      "its good i had typed up a longer review but then play store decided to crash ill just say that firefox for android feels faster and more stable than the default chrome browser also the ui is less clunky\n",
      "its getting there i used to be a chromeopera aficionado but lately they eat too much ram that my phone starts to hang firefox memory consumption is far less and its more stable however i dislike how websites get blurred when scrolling then slowly clear up like a jpeg being downloaded on a slow connection i use 4g and bandwidth aint a problem i know you can fix it but ill give you 4 stars for now thanks for the awesome browser\n",
      "shite crashes constantly test 1st does nothing a browser should obviously as all basic function is gone no testing was executed prior to release      i do not use youtube or any sites that require more than a browser that loads the page without freezing  bonus crashing the operating system\n",
      "the authority firefox is firefox after wandering here and there you are gonna come back to this standard browser in any platform\n",
      "very good but reposition and either fix or remove the share link button the bookmarks not syncing issue was fixed a while back i have been happy with this app for a while now i just forgot to change my previous review that isnt to say that it is without its problems however having gotten used to chrome i find myself pressing share link rather than open link in new tab while this normally isnt a problem lately pressing share link causes the app to crash please either fix this issue and reposition share link lower or remove it altogether\n",
      "yup first thing i thought of for comment was freedom of choicevery important some of the people making choices for us are not well the i thought tony bennetthe good lifeto be sussinct\n",
      "firefox for android ok not full firefox but a good interpretation for small touchscreen devices firefox sync works well bookmarks and search history transfer as expected really helps following up with web searching on the road when i get home to the computer\n",
      "awesome browser really easy to use and more importantly allows you to install ad block extension to get rid off annoying ads love it\n",
      "ive used firefox on all my mobile devices and computers for years but since this latest update its become unusable on my galaxy note 101  links either dont work or take you to a different link on the page and the tops  bottoms of pages are obscured so only around a third of the page is visible and search boxes cant be accessed  i hate the idea of changing to chrome etc but my tablet has been rendered useless for browsing please sort it out mozilla\n",
      "trust worthy as always have been a long time user of firefox in all my desktops and laptops now using it on my android phones as well not settling for any other second rate browser\n",
      "great features on firefox usually i use chrome that its a great app but now firefox upgrade with great features include video player better and downloading you can install and experience yourself have fun and give them a great vote\n",
      "inferior to desktop browser i love firefox on my desktop but the android version is terrible 1 it crashes constantly 2 scrolling is very jerky 3 on screen rotation the window doesnt resize 4 there is no word wrap when answering certain forums 5 downloaded images are not available for use in forums or whatsapp without rebooting phone 6 pages are very slow to load both the preinstalled samsung browser and chrome are heads and shoulders above firefox pity\n",
      "utter garbage didnt think i would be saying this as im a firefox user myself but the browser is utter garbage ive got a samsung galaxy tab s2 and the browser crashes constantly im switching to a different browser \n",
      "refuses to clear history on exit and submitting reports does nothing since i have been reporting this for the last few months for those of you complaining about crashes that is probably because you do not have enough internal memory to run firefox properly\n",
      "great app but one problem ruins it i love the firefox for android its fast and efficient and all the addons are great yet the menu key problem ruins the app firefox will automatically turn on or off the menu key based on if it detects a hardware menu button the only  problem is it gets it wrong sometimes and theres no way to force it\n",
      "unstable freezes and crashes customisatins and capabilities are unmatched but seems to freeze way too much atm some videos wont play that do on other browsers cant even arrange bookmarks looking at other browsers now\n",
      "another update and still crashing previously trieddisabled add on tried re installing another new update crashing every few minutes and still cant sync data\n",
      "nice so far i have been using firefox on my pc for the longest time and love it and its no different from the android version there are a few things i wish were a bit different but all in all im happy with it\n",
      "slow update slow firefox just keeps on getting better with each update  so far its the only one that supports flash wo force close that i have used on 44 kitkat  keep up the great work guys\n",
      "not as good before and rapidly getting worse if used solely for viewing sites without personalization or adjusting the settings this browser has no problems i know of no benefits either issues begin to arise and multiply exponentially upon applying any changes if using a text size other than the default a substantial lagreloading begins to occur when scrolling zooming in or out causes large  portions of previously loaded content to go blank also in one week this went from the download size of 45mb to over 113mb without my adding any extras\n",
      "browser gone back downhill constantly hangs now after last update and fc still does not keep pages in memory when app minimised which is a pain when streaming music etc app does not use user input options ignores them again still no propper changelog for  latest version either in playstore description or on mozzs www page  shame that ff are not listening to its users and seem totally ignorant to the fact that there is a rating system on playstore  also they keep editing my review \n",
      "better background playback and new tab position firefox is the bestlooking browser on android if i do say so myself what i hope for are video sounds playing smoothly when the app runs in the background since i use youtube as ambience a lot and the new tab button being on top of the menu like the other browsers to make navigation easier\n",
      "almost good enough i have tried lots of android browsers the reason being that i like speed and simplicity and good bookmark management thats all i need i tried firefox which i use on desktop as a way of getting away from chrome because i absolutely hate google and everything and everybody associated with it seriously i hate google unfortunately chrome is still hands down the best browser ive used on android firefox started out fine but became slower and glitchier as i used it like everything except chrome meh\n",
      "good as far as i have it fast and reliable for now only thing is that scroll speed is somewhat faast but thats mayth be due some option in phone maybee\n",
      "nice browser but there is no doubt that firefox is one of the best browsers out there be it pc or mobile great options to customize the browser to suit your needs however this still continues to be my secondary browser as cm browser is still way to fast even when loading heavy websites i hope the speed improves in newer versions and ill add a 5 star rating\n",
      "the best android browser fast well designed easy tab management i was looking for a browser easier to use than google chrome and its done great \n",
      "gave u too many chances i love desktop firefox this app is brutally annoying an cumbersome ive installed it about 5 times thinkinghoping it would get better there are much better browsers for android than this eg dolphin or maxthon\n",
      "installed and immediately deleted this crap i have used firefox on my desktop for longer then i can remember and i will continue to only use it on my desktop your only options for a homepage are the crap they want you to see or a blank page with nothing on it and you cant go to a bookmarked website unless you want to go back to their crappy homepage just to see your bookmark list  and did i mention its crap\n",

      "its cool my brother doesnt bug m me anymore i show him angry birds and his mouth shuts but some levels are almost impossible and i have to wait for free power ups or buy them\n",
      "good this is a great game good challenges too something you can just easily wip out when you are bored keep on coming with more great games rovio entertainment\n",
      "1 great game challenging to the point where you dont want to give it up great thing while youre bored waiting or just want to play cant stop playing great job rovio\n",
      "funny this game is nearly perfect except for ads and then you look at the sequel and think wow rovio messed up our beloved birds used to be such a great franchise\n",
      "great game really dislike the ads i usually dont  write reviews but this time i am because its getting  ridiculous every few rounds you play an ad will pop up out of nowhere while you are playing and interrupt your playing sessions making it extremely annoying i know the ads help with money but at least reduce the amount of time until the next ad pops up and forces you to watch it\n",
      "how to upgrade angry birds angry birds is really cool however if you were to upgrade it i would make more birds do different things second make more challenges and be able to customise your own birds with armour and different powers then  when you know what maps you have to destroy you can choose what bird will be best to use\n",
      "great fun very addictive still brilliant loads o fun very clever and hugely moreish and i still love it\n",
      "way to ruin it this game was good at one point  i supported this game with real money  if you cant say anything nice i hope other people can find a good time playing this\n",
      "great little game this is a great little game  i am completely addicted to this game  its simple enough to learn but has enough variety to keep you  interested  this is an ad supported game just so you know  i would be happy to buy the game together rid of the ads however i havent found where to do that yet\n",
      "ads ads and more ads i dont mind having ads but when its a 30 second long commercial between each game it becomes annoying to me i deleted this i dont remember that many ads last time i played this if you can handle ads all the time its a fun game to play but no longer for me\n",
      "awesome game but this is such a great game but there are way to many adds every time you get passed a level theres another add but even with all the adds its still an amazing game\n",
      "angry birds what looks easy can demand a bit of skill the player may become frustrated but is never bored i always find angry birds a great way to pass the time most adverts allow a skip click\n",
      "always entertaining we all know angry birds by now definitely an enjoyable and entertaining game to help you kill time the only thing that i dont like about it are the advertisements when im playing with my wifi of data turned on they can be a bit disruptive during game play\n",
      "freaking awesome it has no real story line but it doesnt matterthis was the first video game i ever played so i obviously love itits almost better than super mario brother for crying out loudthe characters are greatthe pigs are cuteand it has my favorite bird in it hall or green birdnot gonna get in to the details of why i love hall but mea also the pigs forts are awesome so thats why i rated angry birds five out of five game of the year\n",
      "great game too much ads angry birds is fun and a great way to kill time unfortunately it falls short of perfect due to numerous ads littering the game unless you get adfree be prepared to get ads up the butt\n",
      "pretty good the people who dont like the power ups can just turn them off in the first part of the game i also like the reds mighty feathers\n",
      "smart and fun im late to the party if i knew it was this fun id have downloaded it sooner\n",
      "lovely a lovely game for all i love this game so much and my mom too  my mom also enjoy this game so much  thank you rovio team to make this kind of game \n",
      "kinda like a 2d kingdom havoc fun  if kingdom havoc was 2d and used a sling shot itd be close  angry birds is crazy good though  a handful of colorful birds with different and interesting superpowers keep things fresh from level to level  this game gets more difficult along the way but its cool to get better as you practice\n",
      "classic game ruined by ads uninstalled this o one classic game utterly unplayable due to excessive ads installed the other day for my 5 year old to keep him quiet wondered why he kept crying and complaining realised he was constantly being bombarded with adds that took him out of the game after almost every level ridiculous\n",
      "the best game about they dont call this the no1 app for nothing its the original and best clean game about one needs to work out how best to strike the piggy structures by flinging the birds in a sling funny though i thought they had wings it is a wonderful novel idea for a game and will no doubt will continue to appeal to a wide audience for some time to come its as big as what the old lemmings game was in the 1990s its so addictive and fun to play whilst having a good feel about it for me beats angry birds 2 game very easily and will no doubt remain so for the near future the only flaw in it is loads of adds and becomes so slow when connected to the internet but thankfully the in game adds can be binned for a small fee but it also plays fine offline\n",
      "such an awesome game love it a really fun games definitely suggest any reader of this description to get it is so good you will enjoy the game and it doesnt feel like a waste of time afterwards it is very easy to play and its very fun to find ways to knock down the building just by using one bird thoroughly recommend it it is very fun and youre so good so please download this game will be blessed\n",
      "cool really great and awesome graphics offline is great for going to a nowifi place love it\n",
      "i remember back when this was a 3 ipod app not filled with bullshit like adds and powerups go back to what you used to be rio ruined every other angry birds game\n",
      "2many adds great game ruined by too many adds way too many adds now not even fun anymore was great now its terrible\n",
      "game glitches nice you have all the cheesy simple reviews right up first hey robin i was nearly completed the game and i had to uninstallreinstall losing all my achievements and its still freezing up it even switches to one if those annoying 30 ads in the middle of a game is there a reason why my game was working just fine until the update\n",
      "good time waster good fun but getting old and spams ads really bad\n",
      "not the same with my hand on my heart i can honestly say that the first angry birds was great the latter is a horrible mess of horrible games cashing in on the original success unfortunately this hame has suffered the same fate it is no longer the brilliant game it once was its  an updated version with none of the original stuff that once made it great\n",
      "love it i love angry birds i can sit and play on for hours upon end love the challenges they threw at me\n",
      "game ruined because of ads i felt like redownloading after havent playing it in awhile but i was immediately frustrated a 20 second awful mobile game ad popped up after the second level and after looking at the store i realized that you have to pay to remove ads yep uninstalling\n",
      "ads way to many ads cant even enjoy the game with the amount of ads i have to watch every other level theres an ad thats just ridiculous\n",
      "great game but too many ads almost not worth playing\n",
      "fun but hard angry birds is really fun video game that people from at least 6 year olds and people that are a lot a lot a lot of years older than that just one thing its really really hard but a challenge can teach children how to control their tempers even though it can ba a little frustrating\n",
      "too many ads far more adverts than any other game ive played i know its free and they need the ads to make a profit but there needs to be a balance\n",
      "loved it i loooooooooooooovvved it because it is incredible  awesome  and its in go power and make a new clash of clans the same thing  butt better\n",
      "all time legendary game the birthday party levels and short fuse levels are fantasticespecially when the pigs crash onto different chemicals is just greatsuggestion to all those players who cringe about too much ads is close ur wifi connection and then play the gamethen the ads wont trouble you\n",
      "ads are way to heavy listen to the bad reviews there are ads after every round whether you pass it or fail it sometimes there are ads before the next round starts to you spend more time on ads than game play i develop web apps and honestly many people rely on ads to make a living i can appreciate that all to well however these developers have went far beyond that frankly they are disrespectful nitwits\n",
      "fun works perfectly well ads arent as annoying as you think especially for a free game\n",
      "theyre everywhere i see angry birds everywhere because i cant stop playing this game get out my head devs 4  because nothings perfect\n"
